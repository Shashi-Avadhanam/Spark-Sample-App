# Spark Sample Application

This is sample code for me to learn and try different patterns especially for spark streaming.
For all examples, dataset is taken from http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php
Below are the list of classes used for each pattern. The usage of these classes is documented along with the class.

Spark example(Getting started): ActivityMain

Spark streaming example(Getting started): ActivityStreamingMain

Spark SQL example(Getting started): ActivitySQLMain

SparkHiveContext example(Getting started):ActivityHiveMain

Spark Avro example(Getting started): ActivityAvroMain

Apache beam example (Google cloud dataflow API with Spark engine): ActivityGoogleDataflowMain

Spark Kafka integration examples: ActivityKafkaProducer, ProcessingTimeWindowPattern

ActivityKafkaStreamsGenerator class is used to generate the streams for below class.
Event time window pattern(instead of Processing time window) example: EventTimeWindowPattern
